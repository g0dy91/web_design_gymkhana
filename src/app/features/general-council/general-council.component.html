                These members manage all the activities in their respective
                areas with the President coordinating them all. They are
                selected through the general elections which are held at the end
                of each academic year. Each domain has its own Council which
                helps the Secretaries in conducting various activities
                throughout the year. Student Gymkhana is constituted to foster a
                sense of unity among the students. It oversees all the aspects
                of the students' life during their stay at IIT Hyderabad and is
                constantly trying to improve their life here. It also acts as a
                link between the administration and the students.
